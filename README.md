# QA Automation Demo: Node.js with Jest & Playwright

This repository showcases a modern QA automation framework using Node.js. It includes:

- Jest unit tests for core logic and database helpers.
- A page object model with Playwright for cross-browser E2E tests against the Playwright docs site.
- A lightweight API client and tests against the public JSONPlaceholder API.
- A SQLite helper used to demonstrate database testing in isolation.

See the `package.json` scripts for how to run unit, API, DB and end-to-end tests.
